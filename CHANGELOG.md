# 0.0.1
+ POC: a node/express app serving a react/jsx client with no webpack
+ The idea being that you'd create a webpack for qa/prod builds, but use native ES imports locally
+ Major frameworks (i.e. React) should still be compact builds to ease loading time, but use ES modules to import them

# 0.1.0a
+ packaged as a lib
